                    -   Haring opened the Pop Shop in downtown Manhattan in 1986.
                    -   It was an extension of his work where people could buy shirts and buttons with Haring’s designs.
                    -   The entire shop had floor-to-ceiling murals by Haring.
                    -   Some people criticized Haring for making art too commercial.
                    -   “The Pop Shop makes my art accessible. It’s about participation on a big level.”
